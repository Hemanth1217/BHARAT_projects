->Importing Libraries: We start by importing the necessary Python libraries, including NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for plotting, and scikit-learn for preprocessing. We also import relevant modules from TensorFlow and Keras, which are used for building and training the LSTM model.

->Loading Data: You need to have your historical stock price data in a CSV file. Replace 'your_data.csv' with the path to your data file. We read this data into a Pandas DataFrame.

->Choosing the Price Column: In this code, we assume that your data contains a column representing the stock prices. You should replace 'Close' with the actual name of the column that contains the stock prices you want to predict (e.g., 'Open', 'Close', 'Adj Close').

Normalization (MinMax Scaling): It's essential to normalize the stock price data to a range between 0 and 1 to make it suitable for neural network training. We use scikit-learn's MinMaxScaler to perform this scaling.

Creating Input Sequences and Labels: We define a function called create_sequences to generate input sequences and labels for the LSTM model. This function takes a sequence length (e.g., 20 days) and creates sequences of that length from the historical data. The LSTM will use these sequences to make predictions.

Hyperparameters: We specify some hyperparameters, such as seq_length (the length of input sequences) and train_test_split (the percentage of data used for training).

Splitting Data: We split the data into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and the remaining 20% for testing.

Building the LSTM Model: We create an LSTM model using Keras. The model consists of an LSTM layer with 50 units and a ReLU activation function. It's followed by a dense (fully connected) layer with a linear activation function. We compile the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.

Early Stopping: To prevent overfitting, we use early stopping with a patience of 5 epochs. Early stopping monitors the validation loss and stops training if it doesn't improve for a specified number of epochs.

Training the Model: We train the LSTM model using the training data, specifying the number of epochs and batch size. We also use a portion of the training data as a validation set to monitor the model's performance during training.

Making Predictions: After training, we use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.

Inverse Transformation: Since we normalized the data before training, we need to inverse transform both the predictions and the actual values to the original scale using scaler.inverse_transform.

Performance Evaluation (RMSE): We calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's performance. RMSE measures the average error between predicted and actual stock prices. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance.

Visualization: Finally, we use Matplotlib to visualize the actual stock prices (in blue) and the predicted stock prices (in red) to visually assess how well the model is doing.

This code provides a basic framework for stock price prediction using LSTM. Depending on your specific use case and dataset, you may need to fine-tune hyperparameters, experiment with different model architectures, or consider additional features for improved predictions.








# 2. Number Recognition :
Handwritten digit recognition is a computer vision task that involves the recognition of handwritten digits from images or scanned documents. The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset used for training and testing handwritten digit recognition systems. Here's an overview of how such a system works:

MNIST Dataset: The MNIST dataset consists of a large collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). It is widely used as a benchmark dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly neural networks.

Data Preprocessing: Before training a neural network, the dataset is typically preprocessed to prepare the data for training. This includes tasks such as normalizing the pixel values, resizing the images, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Neural Network Model: A neural network is a machine learning model inspired by the structure of the human brain. For handwritten digit recognition, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is commonly used. CNNs are well-suited for image recognition tasks because they can learn hierarchical features from the input data.

Training: The neural network is trained using the training set from the MNIST dataset. During training, the network learns to recognize patterns and features in the handwritten digit images by adjusting its internal parameters (weights and biases) through a process known as backpropagation.

Testing and Validation: After training, the model is evaluated on a separate testing set to measure its performance. The accuracy of the model in correctly classifying handwritten digits is a common metric used to assess its performance.

Prediction: Once the model is trained and validated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen handwritten digit images. The model takes an input image and predicts which digit it represents.

Post-processing: The final output of the model is usually a probability distribution over the ten possible digits (0 through 9). Post-processing may involve selecting the digit with the highest probability as the final prediction.

Handwritten digit recognition systems have various applications, such as:

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Converting handwritten text into digital text.
Digit-based CAPTCHA solving.
Digit recognition in forms and surveys.
Automating data entry from handwritten documents.
Overall, neural networks, particularly CNNs, have proven to be highly effective for handwritten digit recognition tasks, and they have significantly improved the accuracy of such systems over traditional methods.
